Assignment 2: Reflection

I'm going to be honest, I went into this whole thing with no knowledge of what to do. The last site I made was in Grade 7, and with completely different methods. Setting up Django and Python, as well as creating my GitHub account and repos, was quite the conundrum, and I find myself a little embarrassed at how long it actually took me. Once everything was set up, the next set of challenges would arrive, and once again, I find myself lost and confused. I had to look back at the setup guide, watch tutorials on YouTube and the class recordings, as well as Google my problems, but in the end, I managed to get it working. Though I am not fully sure that what I had done was the best or most efficient, Iâ€™ll strive to improve my knowledge and understanding of Django, Python, and HTML so that the embarrassment will never catch up to me again.
